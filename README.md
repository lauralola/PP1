Shanti Yoga and Meditation
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, easy to navigate website for a local yoga studio in Dublin. They wish to provide information on the benefits of a regular yoga and meditation practice, an area to display class times and the various prices and a section to contact the studio and be added to an email list. 

Along with these functions they require a simple and eye catching design that will work across various screen sizes efficiently for their clients. This aims to attract more clients to the studio and also to make it easy for current clients to stay up to date. 

Responsive Mockup

Features

Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is present on all three pages of the site and provides an easy way for the user to move between the pages. Links to the Home page, Schedule section and a Contact page are consistent in position and style across the site. This allows th user to navigate across the page without using the back button and displays which page they are currently on by underlining this. 

Main Page Image

The main image is designed to catch the eye and provide an image of how attending a class might feel. The color scheme is reflected across the site and some overlay text provides information on the location of the studio. 

The Regular Practice Section

This section provides information on the services provided by the studio and the benefit of each. The user will have some basic information on the different options available to them and this may encourage the user to consider joining a class. 

The Footer

The footer includes social media links for the studio which open in a new tab. This allows the user to keep our webpage open when navigating away to our social media platforms. 

Schedule Section

Our timetable provides times for regular classes so users can have information on when they may attend these. The can identify different services and their availability in the studio. Display on this will vary between screen sizes for ease of use. On larger devices the full screen table display will be available and this will be simplified to an easy to read section for smaller devices. 

A section is provided with information on the various memeberships and costs for classes. This provides information to the user on different packages available to them. 

Contact Page

This page allows the user to send a message to the studio to ask for more informtation on a service or to book a service. There is also an option to sign up to an email list for free weekly online meditation. The user is asked to provide their name and email address. 

Features left to implement

A section to allow booking onto classes could be a potential future feature for the project. Within the timeframe provided this was not possible. 

Testing

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
